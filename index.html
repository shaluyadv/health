	<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act as we cope with life. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood and aging. Mental disorders are serious conditions which can affect your thinking, mood, and behavior. They may be occasional or long-lasting. They can affect your ability to relate to others and function each day. Mental disorders are common; more than half of all Americans will be diagnosed with one at some time in their life. But there are treatments. People with mental disorders can get better, and many of them recover completely.

	<p class="sectionTag text-big">Why is mental health important?
 </p>
	<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">More than 450 million people suffer from mental disorders.  According to WHO, by the year 2020, depression will constitute the second largest disease burden worldwide (Murray & Lopez, 1996).  Global burden of mental health will be well beyond the treatment capacities of developed and developing countries.  The social and economic costs associated with growing burden of mental ill health focused the possibilities for promoting mental health as well as preventing and treating mental illness. Thus the Mental Health is linked to behaviour and seen as fundamental to physical health and quality of life.

Physical health and mental health are closely associated and it is proved beyond doubt that depression leads to heart and vascular diseases
Mental disorders also affect persons health behaviour like eating sensibly, regular exercise, adequate sleep, engaging in safe sexual practices, alcohol and tobacco use, adhering to medical therapies thus increasing the risk of physical illness.
Mental ill health also leads to social problems like unemployment, broken families, poverty, drug abuse and related crime.
Poor mental health plays a significant role in diminished immune functioning.
Medically ill patients with depression have worse outcome than those without.
Chronic illnesses like diabetes, cancer, heart disease increases the risk of depression.</p>
